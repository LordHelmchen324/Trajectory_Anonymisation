# trajectory-anonymisation

Implementation of an algorithm for anonymisation of GPS trajectories, developed as part of my bachelor's thesis (can be found [here](https://www.sts.tuhh.de/pw-and-m-theses/2018/kaiser18.pdf)) on *Trajectory Anonymisation by Multivariate Microaggregation*.

This algorithm is a variation based on the algorithm proposed by S. Martinez-Bea and V. Torra [[1]](#1).

Check out [jank324/anonymisation-evaluator](https://github.com/jank324/anonymisation-evaluator.git) for the source code used to evaluate the performance of the algorithm.
